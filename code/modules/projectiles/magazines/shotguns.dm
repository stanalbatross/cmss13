/*
Shotguns don't really use unique "ammo" like other guns. They just load from a pool of ammo and generate the projectile
on the go. There's also buffering involved. But, we do need the ammo to check handfuls type, and it's nice to have when
you're looking back on the different shotgun projectiles available. In short of it, it's not needed to have more than
one type of shotgun ammo, but I think it helps in referencing it. ~N
