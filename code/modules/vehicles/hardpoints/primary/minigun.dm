	//MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS IMPLEMENTATION OF DELAYS:
	//If you spin all the way up and then stop firing, your chained shots will only decrease by 1
	//TODO: Implement a rolling average for seconds per shot that determines chain length without being slow or buggy
	//You'd probably have to normalize it between the length of the list and the actual ROF
	//But you don't want to map it below a certain point probably since seconds per shot would go to infinity

	//So, I came back to this and changed it by adding a fixed reset at 1.5 seconds or later, which seems reasonable
	//Now the cutoff is a little abrupt, but at least it exists. --MadSnailDisease
