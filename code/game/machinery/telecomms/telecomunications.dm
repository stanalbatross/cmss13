/*
	Hello, friends, this is Doohl from sexylands. You may be wondering what this
	monstrous code file is. Sit down, boys and girls, while I tell you the tale.


	The machines defined in this file were designed to be compatible with any radio
	signals, provided they use subspace transmission. Currently they are only used for
	headsets, but they can eventually be outfitted for real COMPUTER networks. This
	is just a skeleton, ladies and gentlemen.

	Look at radio.dm for the prequel to this code.
