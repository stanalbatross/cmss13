/*
Each human has an agent_holder, which contains this datum if they're an Agent, otherwise null.

Creating an agent:
	Make a new /datum/agent(human mob) with a human mob as args,
	if given a faction as a second arg, the agent will be of that faction, else random,
	The agent is added to a global list human_agent_list

Giving objectives to an agent:
	Call give_objective(),
	if given an arg of an objective typepath, it will be that objective else random
