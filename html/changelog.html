				<li class="rscadd">Added new strain to Runner - Acider. They lose all standard runner abilities and are a bit slower than standard runners (about lurker speed)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acider Passive - Acid Storage. Every time Acider Runner is hit, they gain Acid equal to amount of health lost. Acid is also gained (although very slowly) with time. Max amount of acid is 1000</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acider Passive - Acid Slashes. Any Acider melee attack applies an acid on their target and if target was already covered with acid, some amount of acid will be added to acid storage while acid stack on enemy will be regained. This acid can be used by Spitters to activate their acid wave explosion.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acider Active 1 - Corrosive Acid. Spend 100 acid to cover barricade, item or vehicle with boiler acid. The application of acid is 4 times faster than usual.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Acider Active 2 - FOR THE HIVE! Prepare yourself to sacrifice for the hive. Can only be activated when above 200 acid is stored. This changes color of the runner and initiates a sound loop that notifies surrounding hostiles. After 20 seconds Acider Runner will explode covering all barricades in area (acid/100) with normal acid (won't melt reinforced barricades, usual barricades will survive only if repaired at the same time), all enemies with acid stacks, and deal up to 200 burn damage to all enemies in the radius (damage tapers off at max range). If Acider Runner gets killed during this ability, nothing will happen and explosion will be cancelled. If Acider Runner survives and ability activates, after 3 seconds Acider Runner player will get a free (at no cost to the hive) larva if hive has spawning pool. Acider runner can cancel this ability by using it again, but this will set Stored Acid to 0</li>

				<li class="tweak">Completely reworked Boxer Warrior skillset.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Boxer Warrior passive - KO Counter. Every hit against same opponent builds up KO counter. Slashes and disarms give 0.5 counter, while Punch and Jab give 1 counter. Changing target or not attacking target for 5 seconds will reset the counter. This includes abilities and usual attacks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Second Boxer Warrior passive - Clarity. Boxer warrior can shrug off limited number of adverse effects (like daze and knockdown) before those effects can actually do something to it. Boxer Warrior starts with 6 stacks of clarity and regenerates one point each minute. Uppercut regenerates Clarity based on how much KO points they have.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Jab - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 3 ability that Boxer can use to reduce distance. On hit it does not deal damage, but slows and dazes target for 2 seconds (assuming 0 Endurance). It also resets Punch cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Punch - 4 seconds cooldown. Range 2 ability. On hit it deals same amount of damage as usual warrior punch, but does not break bones. This ability also pushes target 1-2 tiles away from you, and resets Jab cooldown.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Uppercut - 10 seconds cooldown. If you are near your target you will automatically hit them. On contact it will put your Jab and Punch on cooldown, reset your KO counter and heal you for 5% of max hp times the KO counter. It will also do following effects if the KO counter is high enough (all of them is KO counter is bigger or equal to 9)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 1 KO point during Uppercut it will deal 15 damage per KO point</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 3 KO points during Uppercut it will knock back target. This knockback scales with KO points and will deal damage if target hits wall.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 6 KO points during Uppercut it will knock down the target for 3 (or more) seconds (assuming no Endurance). This scales with KO points.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have at least 9 KO points during Uppercut, target will be slept for 10 seconds and will be completely out cold.</li>

Timers were increased to avoid cheesy dropping-op-stuff on top of T3s. If these changes lead to tedious megaFOBs, Xenomorphs may be given more tools to destroy them.

Specialist-Activation-One is for scout cloak and toggling broiler-T fuel type. Specialist-Activation-Two is for activating pyro fire shield. You can still macro the specific verbs for those tools, but these specialist ability macros are there so you do not need to keep adding them when a new macroable ability is added.</li>
				<li class="tweak">RNG mechanics related to fire damage and ignition of mobs should be removed. No more flamewalking (unless you're immune). Fire deals the same damage now (no more RNG damage or length of being set on fire). Resisting from fire puts out fires at a consistent amount. Values are subject to change.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a new gamemode called extended no spawn. In this gamemode, marines will not spawn at all and will not be able to latejoin. Might be useful for admins doing events that don't involve marines, such as XvX</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added hive-specific weeds, which will slow you down if you do not match their hive. Hive weeds slow down a xeno a lot more than regular weeds. Weeds will destroy other weeds if they don't match the correct hive, unless it is hive weeds. Xenos no longer regenerate plasma or health when on weeds that belong to a different hive</li>

				<li class="tweak">POs' Powerloader skill has been buffed. The only people with a mid-range powerloader skill are planned to be PFCs after reading a special pamphlet (not in a kit form, but found on colonies around powerloaders).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Some timers have been rebalanced based on the skill changes (like surgery).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dual-wielding SMGs now has a higher scatter than before (due to removing snowflake SMG skill check).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Shipside Synths will have a new role to play in this new skill system. They will be more efficient at tasks with timers than even the specialised roles. This will mean they can prop up an entire department by themselves, so it will be up to the Command to apply them to the right place. Survivor Synthetics are not as well trained - they are only as good as a single trained individual, but still have the variety of skills to apply themselves anywhere.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The Company has recently launched a colony diversity initiative! Not only will the Weston-Yamada colonies not be staffed by clones, they will have actual names and distinct features!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the corpse spawner system to use Select Equipment system for loading gear, generating names, appearances, etc. This means the generated colonists will appear more varied.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">The new USCM protocols have established that walking is now prohibited. All personel must either run or stand still, no inbetween! This extends to every person and creature in the area of operation, civilian or extraterrestrial. (Removed walk intent, it wasn't used anyway, now you will always be running and now have to worry about fat fingering walking intent and dying because of it).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Made WO compile again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Motion detectors should properly disable themselves when a mob dies, gets hugged, gets buckled into a nest, etc.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Retrieve corpses objectives should display how many points they earn you, not only their completion percentage.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Removed some unused infrared sight from xenos (we don't use it anyway, it's a whole other BYOND feature).</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed some null error around holsters.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Dead people's headsets disable themselves automatically. This is for performance reasons. The radios don't disable themselves when you get hugged or nested, so you can preserve that gameplay. To re-enable the headset, just open its menu, it will turn itself on automatically. Hopefully this will improve late-game performance, not having to send messages to 100+ corpses...</li>

				<li class="rscadd">To go along with the new aerodynamic paper, Weston-Yamata has released a line of corporate-exclusive clicky pens, with stylish black, blue and red ink colour variants.

				<li class="tweak">Changed how DEFCON percentage display level is calculated in View Objectives Clues and other places. It will be calculated as a ratio of total points gathered vs what you need to unlock the next level (and counting upwards). This means for example once you reach 100% DEFCON 5 you will be dropped to 50% DEFCON 4. This should give everyone a better estimate of how much work is still to be done.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Survivor rescue objective now handles the fact that Synths can be repaired after death.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Objectives now have a guaranteed minimal amount of clues generated. Folders and Disks have two, safes have four, experimental items have eight.

				<li class="rscadd">Added a new Boiler strain, Trapper.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Trapper is designed to be a glass cannon zone controller and powerful siege engine.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Removed default round start buff to upgrade and evolution for xenos</li>
				<li class="tweak">Evolution and Upgrade speed is now tied to number of xenos (more xenos, less upgrade), marines (more marines, more upgrade) and time (more time, more upgrade). To top it off, it is all finally related to number of Larva. If you have no larva, this bonus is not applied. The more larva you have, the proportionally more upgrade speed you will have. These effects are active only when queen is in ovipositor or first few minutes of the round.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Example, 100 marines, 10 xenos and 30 larva. Boost is 6.5x for the first ten minutes then it goes to 13x if NO XENOS JOIN after 40 minutes. If xenos keep joining as larva numbers lower, it will taper down, it will be about 1x when there are no larva left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Returned basic increase for first 30 minutes for upgrade level and evolution. Now it's a maximum of two systems, whatever is bigger will be applied.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos can now see their Evilution Boost level</li>
				<li class="tweak">Humans that are running AND without suit armor (that is actually an armor and not a santa suit) can now be neuroed in one hit. This applies to all neuro shots.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added a delivery chute in the OT workshop and research lobby that transports items to the requisitions.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Automated Chemical Integrated Delivery harness (A.C.I.D.). This special vest is will progressively scan its wearer for specific health issues and injecting its medicine when the conditions are met. Additionally it will also report the overall health to the wearer. Inspiration from #8988 by Alardun.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The A.C.I.D. harness inject conditions can be configured by using a multitool/security access tuner on the vest.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Research will start with two A.C.I.D. harnesses. More can be assembled by using a wirecutter on a webbing vest containing one healthanalyzer, radio, cable coil, hypospray and a battery.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a new type of randomly spawned research note, research grants. Scanning these at the research data terminal will reward research credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the chemical properties excreting, hypometabolizing, hypermetabolizing, sedative. Inspiration from #8970 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added 10 rare chemical properties. One rare property will now spawn in clearance level 3 and 4 chemicals at a 30% and 100% rate respectively, to make them extra special. Inspiration from #8914 by Watermelon914.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hyposprays now have an internal vial that it uses as a magazine. This can be ejected after unlocking the hypospray with a screwdriver. You can still fill the hypospray directly if it has a vial in it, which will technically just transfer to the vial instead.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now add autoinjectors to vial boxes. The research centrifuge can now be used to fill autoinjectors. Boxes of empty autoinjectors has been added to research.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The research centrifuge will now only fill everything in the centrifuge uniquely if the input container has more than one chemical. Otherwise it will try to fill everything up.</li>
