			<h2 class="date">29 May 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added a combat click-drag override preference. When this is set and you're on disarm or harm intent, depressing the mouse triggers a click immediately even if you hold it down. Clicking something in your inventory, yourself, or an ally behaves normally, unless you're a xeno clicking with an empty hand. This applies to all clicks, including shooting and middle-mouse abilities.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The game will now only process one click per mouse-down. This shouldn't have any practical effect on the game aside from stopping the above from triggering extra clicks.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added mentorhelp default reply for above pref.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">forest2001 updated:</h3>

			<h3 class="author">ChainsawMullet updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Lurker's Invisibility will now always apply a 20% speed boost until the invisibility ends, rather than being dependent on no xenos being nearby.</li>

			<h2 class="date">25 May 2021</h2>
			<h3 class="author">50RemAndCounting updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Added a Surgical Webbing Vest to the synthetic gear vendor and the field surgery supplies room in medbay, a new webbing type that can hold only surgical tools and nothing else. Can currently hold the entirety of current surgical tray's contents, values and stats subject to future change. Sprites done by Nauticall!</li>

				<li class="tweak">Changed the Synth Councillor gear preset to spawn with the leather satchel instead of the standard USCM satchel to be more in line with the rest of the council-exclusive fancy clothing.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Default BYOND statusbar.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Custom status bar that is above input now and properly changes between darkmode and lightmode.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a preference for hiding the statusbar.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Using a bayonet to cut the sleeves off of uniforms fixed - no more spamming cutting on uniforms that have already had their sleeves removed, plus the safety check now functions and means you won't honk your uniform if it doesn't have cut sleeve sprites.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Patches/armbands no longer display on-mob if the uniform's sleeves were cut off.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Patches/armbands now show on marine snow uniforms with their collar rolled or cut off.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Can now pin medals onto mobs properly. This includes yourself, as well as other people. Existing code, but terribly broken. Added some safety checks while I was at it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Can now perform unga macho bullshit medal award ceremonies by harm-intent punching the medal into the recipient's flesh.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Attaching clothing accessories to jacket items with inventories no longer tries to put them into storage, breaking the overlay sprite.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A variety of jacket-type items can now have accessories attached to them. For ex. detective/CMB jackets, pilot flak jacket, hazard vests, labcoats. Marine service/dress/officer jackets already had this. Exactly which categories an item can take depends on it, IE vests can't have armbands or patches, CMB/detective jacket already have badges where a medal would go, CO dress and bomber jackets have bling or fur where rank tabs would attach. Rank tabs only attach to marine service/dress jackets. No jacket- or suit-type item can attach webbings or shoulder holsters. If you attach a flashy hooah moto patch to your ghillie suit and the CLF counter-snipers get you, it's your own fault.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can also hang medals off of most armours, but remember that bling makes for a good bullseye. Also, it will fall off of your armour when the medic removes it to zap you back to life.</li>
				<li class="tweak">When spawning in, the game now attempts to attach playtime medals to your jacket/armour first, if possible.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Screaming after being splashed with xeno blood now checks if YOU can feel pain, rather than the xeno who did the bleeding.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Misc. typo fixes, minor code adjustments to facilitate the above changes.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixes click delay bug I introduced with inserting items into the inventory screen of worn/carried storage items (belts etc) and internal storages (webbings, spec GL). Putting things into a worn/carried storage item should not be affected by action delay; taking items out should.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Due to a code simplification, interacting with an item in a storage item using another item applies action delay again, if the storage isn't in your inventory. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is inside a satchel.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Tables and racks are now 'transparent' for the purposes of adjacency checks, IE it calculates as though the item were sitting on the same tile as the table. This fixes a bug I introduced with not being able to insert items into the inventory screen of a storage item on a table (surgery tray) and probably fixes something else somewhere also.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Click delay for interacting with tables+racks moved to their code, rather than being checked for by all clicks. Additionally, the 0.2s delay is now specifically for putting items on surfaces, rather than also applying to interacting with items which are on a surface. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is on a table.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Refactors xenomorph attack click delay behaviour. Xeno attacks now count as a full-delay XENO_ATTACK_ACTION, 0.4 second XENO_NONCOMBAT_ACTION, zero delay XENO_NO_DELAY_ACTION, or half-delay. Error messages have no delay. This does mean 'You can't do that!'-type messages are spammable, but only the user can see those.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">A missed xeno melee attempt now has a half-delay and audio-visual feedback, plus a message. Should make the true causes of 'eaten clicks' more apparent.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Xenos can no longer click tiles to attack mobs in them. The functionality still exists but is now accessed indirectly through directional attacks and the next change. Weeds & blood etc. often blocked this anyway.</li>
				<li class="tweak">As a xeno, clicking your own sprite now attacks the tile underneath the mouse pointer. This means that you will no longer miss otherwise-viable attacks because your own dummy thicc sprite got in the way.</li>
				<li class="tweak">If conducting a tile attack where you and a prone enemy are on the same tile, it will now attempt to target the enemy rather than the standing mob (you).</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Nibbling allied xenos removed: no attack delay for harm-intent clicking them.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Timed xeno actions (as distinguished from ability actions) such as tipping vending machines etc. now apply delays when they *start*, rather than when they finish.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Attack delay for missing a directional attack is now 0.25 seconds, down from (usually) 1 second.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Directional attacks now calculate angles more precisely, so your mouse doesn't need to be perfectly lined up to attack in a cardinal direction.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The non-help intent self-harm preference toggle doesn't apply to xenomorphs anymore, as they can't do anything to themselves unless someone someday gives them weapon items. This prevents the toggle from messing you up when you click your own sprite while trying to attack someone.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed the layer of the residue left by an abandoned ovipositor so that it's above weeds and weed nodes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added xeno attack animation to slashing resin, resin nests, dropship chairs, claymores, broken powerloader wreckage, discarded ovipositor object, empty eggs, resin fruits, tipping vending machines.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Only attacks on mobs add to xeno slash stats. Previously all xeno clicks did, making it a useless statistic.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xenos no longer need to be on harm intent to open lockers.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Xeno snow clearing must be done on disarm or grab intents, as harm intent counts as a missed slash and help intent does nothing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Clicking resin structures (spikes, sticky resin etc.) on help intent applies no delays.</li>
