				<li class="bugfix">Fixes click delay bug I introduced with inserting items into the inventory screen of worn/carried storage items (belts etc) and internal storages (webbings, spec GL). Putting things into a worn/carried storage item should not be affected by action delay; taking items out should.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Due to a code simplification, interacting with an item in a storage item using another item applies action delay again, if the storage isn't in your inventory. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is inside a satchel.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Tables and racks are now 'transparent' for the purposes of adjacency checks, IE it calculates as though the item were sitting on the same tile as the table. This fixes a bug I introduced with not being able to insert items into the inventory screen of a storage item on a table (surgery tray) and probably fixes something else somewhere also.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Click delay for interacting with tables+racks moved to their code, rather than being checked for by all clicks. Additionally, the 0.2s delay is now specifically for putting items on surfaces, rather than also applying to interacting with items which are on a surface. Example: pouring liquid into a beaker which is on a table.</li>
