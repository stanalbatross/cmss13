			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

			<h3 class="author">alardun updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Added the nailgun, a hybrid tool/weapon found in most colonies in the engineering department (or similar location). Ammo are scarce and located with the nailgun. It is pistol-sized and fit in a backpack. Thanks to Thwomper and monkeyfist101 for the sprites and audio!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The nailgun fires armor-piercing nails with stats similar to the M39 AP rounds, with a similar ROF, though with no burst. It has slightly higher falloff and has poor accuracy further than 4 tiles out, but can be used as a weapon in a pinch. It slows target on hit for one second (The duration stacks!)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hitting a enemy that is directly perpendicular to a wall (Projectile -> Target -> Wall) or an obstacle that would've blocked it with the nailgun does bonus damage (50%) and cause a larger slow for a short duration. To clarify, obstacle here refers to object (doors, barricade, windows, etc).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hitting a T1 xeno or a human with a point-blank hit with the nailgun while there's a wall or an obstacle that would've blocked it behind them immobilize the target for 3 seconds. You cannot have your frozen duration reset while already immobilized.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using the nailgun on a wall or reinforced wall sporting a hole will fix it after 6 seconds at the cost of three sheet of wood/metal/plasteel, and 12 nails and a 6s channel. It also restores 5% integrity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using the nailgun on a damaged wall or reinforced wall will repair integrity at the cost of 1 sheet of material and 4 nails, 2 second channel. Wood repairs 5%, metal repairs 10% and plasteel repairs 20%.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The above applies to wooden barricade, folding barricade, barricade and plasteel barricade. This can be used to fix barricade below the welder threshold. Wood on wood : 100%, Metal on folding, metal barricade: 20%, plasteel on folding, metal barricade: 25%. Plasteel on plasteel barricade: 20%. This consumes 4 nails and 1 unit of material and takes 2 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Using wood on a wood barricade repairs the barricade by 50%, down from 100%.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The hypo now handles much like a pistol; hold it and click it with an empty hand to remove the chemical vial; hold an unloaded hypo and click it with a vial to load it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have medical skills, you can click a vial with an unloaded hypospray, or click-drag a vial to an unloaded hypo, to perform a 'tactical reload'. This will transfer the old vial into your other hand, or drop the old vial on the ground if your hands are full.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The hypo can still be filled without removing the vial; it fills like any other beaker or flask, including pill dissolving, reagent tanks, and transfers from other vials. Of course, you can't transfer chemicals into a hypospray that doesn't have a vial.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The top-up port has a one-way valve; if you want to remove reagents from a hypospray, either syringe it or remove the vial.</li>

Your collision is removed (you still can get shot by non-friendly projectiles), you become near-invisible, and you enable Aimed Shot. Moving breaks the cloak entirely, and shooting make you more visible for 5 seconds. The shooting visibility debuffs stack and only resets once you stop firing for 5 seconds.</li>

Display a lock-on on the target and channels for 1.25 seconds, then automatically fire at the target if the bullet has a chance to connect (No turf/blocking structure in the way/ Line of sight is still there). The shot is homing, though somewhat dodgeable if you can get an obstacle in time. If the shot connects with the intended recipient, the projectile does a critical hit, described below.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added a critical hit effect to Sniper Marksman Bullet. It deals 3x the normal amount of damage (70 -> 210).</li>

				<li class="tweak">The Synthesis Simulator will now display the expected new OD threshold of a chemical before running the simulation.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Added a new mode to the Synthesis Simulator, CREATE mode. This mode allows researchers to create a new chemical from scratch.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">When creating a new chemical, researchers get to choose the properties, OD, name, and the rarity of recipe components.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cost of creating a new chemical is based on all of the following. The level of each property, the number of property slots used, the OD level and the rarity of each component. Basic, common, uncommon and rare components add a +7, +4, +1 and -5 modifier to the cost respectively. Negative properties and most neutral, depending on the value of the property, decrease the cost rather than increase it. A penalty cost is added for each property above level 5 (+1 at 6, +2 at 7, +4 at 8, +5 at 9, +7 at 10). The minimum cost of creating a chemical is 5 credits.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The properties ATX, ACR, NGN, HPX, TXC and CRS are available for creation mode at round start. Scan chemicals in the XRF analyzer to make more properties available. Anomalous properties can not be added via create mode.</li>
				<li class="wip">CREATE mode does not take into consideration whether the properties you enabled might conflict and cancel each other out. So don't try this, you'll just waste your credits.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed an old bug with how we check if a recipe already exists. This was why researchers more often that they were supposed to, ended up with recipes of 4 or more components and why the simulator seemed biased towards adding more rare components.</li>
