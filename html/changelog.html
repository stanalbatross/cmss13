			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="bugfix">DNR marines will be flagged as *Deceased* immediately on view crew manifest</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Sigil updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Default req claymores can be planted again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">You can now deploy mines without detonators, although they still won't actually do anything. So check that there's an assembly inside before planting.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheDonkified updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Queen can no longer be gibbed.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Scopes should properly remove their buffs from a gun after unscoping via a UI button or a verb.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Modified the formatting of the statbrowser tabs. Verbs should no longer have weird line spacing and the spacing between verbs and categories is reduced.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Can now set the fontsize for the contents of statbrowser tabs, but not the tabs themselves.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Added HTML_FILE define for when you're directly writing out an HTML file in code. For example, this is applicable for the browsers we have in-game.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Modified the send_rsc define to accept variable arguments (should only be one or two if you are using it correctly).</li>
				<li class="tweak">Status panel for observers shows DEFCON level.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hive status displays the amount of guaranteed slots left.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hive status will now update every 2 seconds when queen is alive and every 10 seconds when queen is dead.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Converted spaces to tabs in the hive_status.dm file.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed how evolving calculates the number of open slots.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Hive status displays the correct number of T2s and T3s now.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Weapons set to burst can now be fired point-blank.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The burst will track the target as long as you remain within one tile of it. If you move apart, any remaining shots in the burst will lose lock and be fired normally towards its most recent position.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">While the first shot in a PB is still perfectly accurate, subsequent shots in a burst check accuracy as usual. At PB range, this mostly only matters to people trying to onehand massively inaccurate weapons. Shotgun pellets still count as the first shot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Missed PB burst projectiles fly safely into the ground or ceiling -- unless, as mentioned above, you move apart. If the target is prone and you move away from it, the fact that the bullets are not tracking it means that they will fly over its head.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pointblank behaviour is based upon the bullet fired, bonus damage against prone targets, and an inconsistent damage buff that depends on which specific gun you're using. If a gun does not do something on a normal hit, it won't do it on a PB.  Unless the ammo is specifically coded to do so, I.E. the nailgun or battlefield execution. Buckshot stunning on point-blank is a characteristic of buckshot, not point-blanks.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Attempting to PB with an unloaded gun now goes *click*. Will hopefully clear up some "Why didn't my gun go off?" situations.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Firing an underbarrel shotgun from an unloaded gun should no longer display *click* unnecessarily.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">A bullet flyby sfx was using the wrong filepath, and should now be audible.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Hijack surge's pooled larva cooldown is now a minute and a half, reduced linearly over time up to a minimum of 30 seconds after 20 minutes.</li>
				<li class="tweak">The reason behind this is because while the spawn pool currently punishes hell-holds, it also punishes basically everything: Either your push needs to instantly break the xenos or you get overwhelmed. Making it incremental, and break surge on destruction will give a incentive to pushing without punishing it.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added the nailgun, a hybrid tool/weapon found in most colonies in the engineering department (or similar location). Ammo are scarce and located with the nailgun. It is pistol-sized and fit in a backpack. Thanks to Thwomper and monkeyfist101 for the sprites and audio!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The nailgun fires armor-piercing nails with stats similar to the M39 AP rounds, with a similar ROF, though with no burst. It has slightly higher falloff and has poor accuracy further than 4 tiles out, but can be used as a weapon in a pinch. It slows target on hit for one second (The duration stacks!)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hitting a enemy that is directly perpendicular to a wall (Projectile -> Target -> Wall) or an obstacle that would've blocked it with the nailgun does bonus damage (50%) and cause a larger slow for a short duration. To clarify, obstacle here refers to object (doors, barricade, windows, etc).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Hitting a T1 xeno or a human with a point-blank hit with the nailgun while there's a wall or an obstacle that would've blocked it behind them immobilize the target for 3 seconds. You cannot have your frozen duration reset while already immobilized.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using the nailgun on a wall or reinforced wall sporting a hole will fix it after 6 seconds at the cost of three sheet of wood/metal/plasteel, and 12 nails and a 6s channel. It also restores 5% integrity.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Using the nailgun on a damaged wall or reinforced wall will repair integrity at the cost of 1 sheet of material and 4 nails, 2 second channel. Wood repairs 5%, metal repairs 10% and plasteel repairs 20%.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The above applies to wooden barricade, folding barricade, barricade and plasteel barricade. This can be used to fix barricade below the welder threshold. Wood on wood : 100%, Metal on folding, metal barricade: 20%, plasteel on folding, metal barricade: 25%. Plasteel on plasteel barricade: 20%. This consumes 4 nails and 1 unit of material and takes 2 seconds.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Buffed Defender.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced crest toggling cooldown to two seconds. Toggling crest now also lowers speed twice as much and increases mob size, meaning lowered crest defenders resist stuns the same way hivelords and carriers do. You can now headbutt with lowered crest as both strains.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Changed how headbutt works significantly. Headbutt deals 20 damage with 5 penetration to the chest, only works next to the target, and pushes the target away 3 tiles. Lowered crest headbutt has a 3 tile homing range and deals 30 damage with 5 penetration to the chest, but pushes only one tile away.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Slamming into a wall after being thrown or flung into one now gives a message and sound indicating the hit.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Steelcrest defenders are no longer almost as fast fortified as they are unfortified. They are now slightly slower than pre-buff, and have reduced armor. However, they can still headbutt with a 1-tile push range, and can slash marines to deal 10 damage.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Bug with attempting to remove unlocked hyposprays from inventory pulling the vial out fixed. Bugs with hyposprays filling from any reagent container fixed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Hyposprays and autoinjector sfx are a bit more audible now. Emergency autoinjectors now have a very distinct sfx.</li>
				<li class="rscdel">Hypospray unlocked state made default, vial lock removed. Autoinjectors no longer have a vestigial vial lock verb.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Examining a hypospray now displays its vial and remaining reagent volume, if any, and its current dose setting.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The hypo now handles much like a pistol; hold it and click it with an empty hand to remove the chemical vial; hold an unloaded hypo and click it with a vial to load it.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">If you have medical skills, you can click a vial with an unloaded hypospray, or click-drag a vial to an unloaded hypo, to perform a 'tactical reload'. This will transfer the old vial into your other hand, or drop the old vial on the ground if your hands are full.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The hypo can still be filled without removing the vial; it fills like any other beaker or flask, including pill dissolving, reagent tanks, and transfers from other vials. Of course, you can't transfer chemicals into a hypospray that doesn't have a vial.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The top-up port has a one-way valve; if you want to remove reagents from a hypospray, either syringe it or remove the vial.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">For the most part, this is all *additional* functionality - you can still use it in the same way you did before without any problems.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">The M2C Heavy Gunner Kit comes with 2 sticks of C4, a tool pouch with an industrial welder, a crowbar, a wrench and an fire extinguisher to help with creating breaches in fences, cades or doors, a M10 Technician Helmet to shield the user's eyes, a pamphlet for engineering training and a M2C Heavy Machinegun System along with 500 rounds of ammunition in 125-round ammo boxes with a holster to stow this ammo. This kit is heavily designed for short and decisive attacks, and creating new flanks for marines to take advantage of to pressure Xenos.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Introduces M2C Heavy Machinegun, an upgraded and revised version of the M56D; it comes with full automatic fire capability and higher damage and rate of fire but less AP than the M56D, along with a more flexible and reactive tripod.

Furthermore, it cannot be built near cades (adjacent tiles) in a 3x3 bubble, encouraging aggressive placement and positioning.</li>
