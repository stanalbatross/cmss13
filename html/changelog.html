			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Vanagandr updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Removed attack_speed delay when clicking one item with another when in storage (backpacks pouches etc.). Delay varied based on attacking item.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced delay when putting items on tables/racks. Delay varied based on item, is now 0.2 seconds.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed extra delay when picking up an item not in first-layer inventory (in backpack, on table, on floor etc.). Total delay was 0.6 seconds, is now 0.2. The pickup verb 0.8 second delay was not changed.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Removed extra delay when clicking things in inventory with an open hand. If an item in pocket, clothing, opening a pouch etc. total delay was 0.05 seconds, now 0; if drawing item from fast-draw toggled pouches etc. total delay was 0.25 seconds, is now 0.2.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Clicking the inventory spacers in slotless storage items (satchels, backpacks, some boxes) now behaves exactly the same as clicking the item sprites directly. With the item-removal click delays now 0.2s across the board, the main effect of this is that you can't pull things (M15...) out of your satchel while resting or in a xeno stomach.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Can't attempt to throw stuff at objects inside storage items anymore.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Updated mob/../carbon attackhand to add the attack delay to the *attacker* rather than the victim. Originally they all had this code but humans and xenos were updated to their current state while /carbon was left unchanged. Being punched/disarmed should no longer add action delay to you. Note that this is for human -> human or human -> xeno attacks with an open hand; this had nothing to do with xeno -> human attacks.</li>

If a gun does not do something on a normal hit, it won't do it on a PB.  Unless the ammo is specifically coded to do so, I.E. the nailgun or battlefield execution.
