			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Weapons set to burst can now be fired point-blank.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The burst will track the target as long as you remain within one tile of it. If you move apart, any remaining shots in the burst will lose lock and be fired normally towards its most recent position.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">While the first shot in a PB is still perfectly accurate, subsequent shots in a burst check accuracy as usual. At PB range, this mostly only matters to people trying to onehand massively inaccurate weapons. Shotgun pellets still count as the first shot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Missed PB burst projectiles fly safely into the ground or ceiling -- unless, as mentioned above, you move apart. If the target is prone and you move away from it, the fact that the bullets are not tracking it means that they will fly over its head.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Pointblank behaviour is based upon the bullet fired, bonus damage against prone targets, and an inconsistent damage buff that depends on which specific gun you're using. If a gun does not do something on a normal hit, it won't do it on a PB.  Unless the ammo is specifically coded to do so, I.E. the nailgun or battlefield execution. Buckshot stunning on point-blank is a characteristic of buckshot, not point-blanks.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Attempting to PB with an unloaded gun now goes *click*. Will hopefully clear up some "Why didn't my gun go off?" situations.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Firing an underbarrel shotgun from an unloaded gun should no longer display *click* unnecessarily.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">A bullet flyby sfx was using the wrong filepath, and should now be audible.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Using the nailgun on a damaged wall or reinforced wall will repair integrity at the cost of 1 sheet of material and 4 nails, 2 second channel. Wood repairs 5%, metal repairs 10% and plasteel repairs 20%.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The above applies to wooden barricade, folding barricade, barricade and plasteel barricade. This can be used to fix barricade below the welder threshold. Wood on wood : 100%, Metal on folding, metal barricade: 20%, plasteel on folding, metal barricade: 25%. Plasteel on plasteel barricade: 20%. This consumes 4 nails and 1 unit of material and takes 2 seconds.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added the Gardener Strain for the drone. Ability details down below. Thanks Triiodine for all of the sprites. It benefits from slightly (5%) increased health regen.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Ability 1: Plant Fruit. (Macro 3). Plant an instance of the currently selected fruit (up to 3 fruits total). Consumes 50 health and 100 plasma. These fruits take some time to mature, and can be consumed by Xenomorph to gain an effect depending on the fruit's type. (See below)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Greater Resin Fruit. This fruit heals 75 health instantly, and rapidly heal another 100 over a few ticks. It takes 30s to mature.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Unstable Resin Fruit. This fruit heals 75 health over a longer # of ticks, and also gives an overshield for 30% of max health, up to 200. This shield begins to decay after 90 seconds, at a rate of 10 per second. Does not stack with itself. It takes 45s to mature.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added Spore Resin Fruit. This fruit passively gives off Level 1 Recovery pheromones in a range of one tile, and when consumed, makes each slashes increase your cooldown reduction by 5%, up to 25%. This buff lasts for 60 seconds. This mean any future cooldown will be reduced by that percentage. It takes 15s to mature.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Added Lesser Resin Fruit. This fruit heals 75 health instantly when consumed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Healer Drone also gain Plant Fruit, but may only plant Lesser Resin Fruit.</li>
